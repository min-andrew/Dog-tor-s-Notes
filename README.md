# Dog-tor's Notes

## Description

This application is for dog owners who would like an easy and informative app to track their dog’s health. This app allows users to monitor various aspects of their dog’s health, such as their medical appointments, issues, concerns, daily habits, and tasks. Users can also connect with the greater dog community by sharing their thoughts and comments.

<br>
For this application, we used the following technologies: React, Apollo GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, NodeJS, Express, JWT, Heroku, Cloudinary,  Nodemon, along with JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS and Semantic UI.
<br><br>

Some of the challenges we faced in creating this app included connecting to the backend and using GraphQL for the first time on a MERN project. We had some struggles with Cloudinary. And working with Semantic UI turned out to be quite limiting, due to their CSS library overruling our own.
<br><br>
In the future, we would like:

- Calendar, reminders, notifications for important dates and appointments
- Area to upload and access sensitive information (documentation/report of visit, insurance cards, etc)
- Make individual pet profiles that connect to their respective vet notes
- Connect todo list and habit tracker to database
- Storefront
